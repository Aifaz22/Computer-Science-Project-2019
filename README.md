# Computer-Science-Project-2019
A group project in a 2019 Computer Science course.

This project is considered to be an application of animation, or a game.

The main concept of the game is to keep a similar layout between levels, but to change some mechanics to progress.

As of Demo 1, only one (incomplete) level has been done.
